					Additional Information
When you use my program and lose all your lives or get all the flags in order to win the game. It will 
not automatically tell the player that he or she has won the game. In order for that to happen you must 
tick the game. Then it will display the game won or loss screen. I added some extra features when the 
player wins or loses the game. It will print to the console that he or she has won and the number of times 
the clock has ticked. It will also pop up on the gui if the player wants to restart the game or not. 
Clicking yes to restart resets the game as if it were a brand new game. Please don’t knock me points for 
adding that gui element to my game. I also didn’t know if were supposed to match her buttons exactly or 
change them. I matched them since I was not sure, but I could easily change them since I made my own custom 
button class. I tried to implement what you gave me from assignment 1. As far as that I think my program runs 
pretty well. Thank you for reading.

Best
