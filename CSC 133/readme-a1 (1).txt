Additional Information:
disclaimer if my ant’s health is at 0 or the lives is at 0 is won’t lose a life until the t command is pressed.
 Same if it has 0 lives it won’t display the game over until the game has ticked again. Also I left in print 
statements that are meant to  help the user visualize what has changed. For example, if the speed is increased 
it will print the increased speed to the console. All the data is still updated in the 'm' and 'd' commands. 
If this bothers you, please let me know and I can remove it. Thank you in advance.
